----------- Overall evaluation -----------
This paper studies the following machine scheduling problem with n jobs and m identical machines.
Each job j has an arrival ("release") time, a processing time ("volume"), and a time deadline.
The objective is to find a minimum cost feasible schedule for the jobs. Here for each machine
there is a cost of $1 for each unit of time it is turned ON (whether it is used or not).
There is no cost if the machine is turned OFF, but it costs $q to start each machine.

The intention of this formulation is to model energy costs. The model itself is very simple but it is quite natural, so I think the problem is worthy of study.

The main result of the paper is a 3-approximation algorithm. This is worse that the current best
factor 2-approximation algorithm, but it has the benefit of being a combinatorial algorithm
rather than a complex linear programming rounding algorithm. There is already another constant factor combinatorial approximation algorithm in the literature but it has a slightly worse approximation guarantee, i.e. 6.

The main positive of the paper is that the technical quality is very good. The greedy algorithm studied is simple but the methods the authors use to analyze it are highly non-trivial. The results themselves are also interesting but, at the same time, not particularly important (e.g. as stated above, the approximation algorithm does not improve on prior guarantees and neither is it the first combinatorial constant factor approximation algorithm). The main drawback with the paper with the paper is that it is not well-written and the proofs are hard to follow in places.

This paper has a lot of potential. It is certainly publishable and could be a very nice paper, but I think it would benefit greatly from major revisions.

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
This paper considers the problem of scheduling jobs on parallel machines to minimize the energy. There is a collection of jobs with known release times, deadlines, and processing requirements. A processor can be active or sleeping. The processors use 1  unit of energy for every time slot they are on and q units of energy to move from off state to on state. All jobs must be scheduled preemptively on one or more machines to minimize the energy, and no job can be processed on more than one machine simultaneously.

This problem has been studied for almost two decades, and the case when there is a single machine is well understood. However, we still don't know if the problem is solvable in polynomial time for an arbitrary number of (parallel) machines, and is one of the major open problems in the area of energy efficient scheduling. Antoniadis et al. gave a 3-approximation algorithm for the problem on parallel machines by rounding a natural LP relaxation. In a subsequent work, they improved their approximation ratio to 2 and also gave a simple combinatorial 6-approximation algorithm. A simple left-to-right greedy 2-approximation algorithm for a single machine was given by Irani et al.

In this paper, the author gives a natural generalization of the left-to-right algorithm for the parallel machine case, and uses the recent ideas introduced in the papers by Antoniadis et al. to show that this algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of 3. The algorithm processes the machines in an arbitrary order. While processing a machine, the algorithm tries to keep the machine in an off state for as long as possible, and once machine is switched on, it tries to keep it in the on state for as long as possible, while maintaining feasibility of the instance. The trick is to analyze the critical sets which show up when deciding when to switch on/off the machine.

I think that this is a nice contribution. The algorithm is combinatorial, simple and fast (and probably implementable), and could give some insights into settling the complexity of the parallel machine case. The only complaint I have is the presentation. I think the author should give more intuition for (many) definitions and lemmas, and it should be possible to present the whole argument better.

Please see below for more detailed comments on the paper's presentation:

?TODO: (6) Don't define definitions within lemma statements if they are going to be used elsewhere. This goes for  definition of tight set for engagement t off processor k and the definition of a critical set.
TODO? (4 cases of what Alg2 does (only closes some valley or reduces Sup)): (13) I recommend breaking up the proof of Lemma 17  more. You could have a separate lemma that invariants 1 and 2 imply invariant  3. Then you could have a lemma proving invariant 1 and 2 hold. It's also not clear to me why the 4 cases cover all options. You should explain this before casing.

The paper considers the offline problem of scheduling a collection of jobs with release times, deadlines and sizes on a collection of identical machines that may be shutdown with the objective of mnimizing the total time the processors that the processors are on plus the number of shut downs. There are 10ish papers in the literature on some variation of this problem.  The most relevant results are 2-approximation algorithm based on LP round, and a 6-approximation combinatorial algorithm for this problem.

The main result of this paper is to show that a natural generalization of the 2-approximate greedy algorithm for 1 processor is 3-approximate for multiple processors.  The analysis is based on understanding well the structure of the schedule produced by this greedy algorithm.  So in spirit this is a "simplicity" result with respect to algorithm design, but perhaps not with respect to algorithm analysis.

This is a semi-classical problem. The paper is well written. The results are elegant. This should be a clear accept.
